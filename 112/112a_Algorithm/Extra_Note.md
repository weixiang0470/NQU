# **Chap 1**
Computational Thinking(CT)
- A thinking way to solve problem throughth computer logic, an ability to turn computation into abstraction
- Proposed by **Jeannette M.Wing** in 2006 

Computational Thinking for Educators by Google
1. Decomposition
    - A problem can be decompose into smaller subproblem
    - Solve all the subproblem == solve the problem
2. Pattern Recognition
    - Get the **feature/rule** from a large data set to **identify/classify** the data set
    - When the subproblem/other problem having the same feature then we solve it with the same solution
3. Pattern Generalization and Abstraction
    - To **filter/ignore** unnecessary feature/rule 
    - Focus on the more important feature/rule to concretize the problem
    - ex: Mind map (Tony Buzan in 1970)
4. Algorithm
    - A well design plan to solve the problem
    - A program to solve the problem in a finite step

Requirement of Algorithm
1. Input
    - 0 or multiple input data, all input data need a clear defination
2. Output
    - At least 1 ouput
3. Definiteness
    - Every step need to have clear defination
4. Effectiveness
    - Every step need to be clear and effective, user can get the result by itself
5. Finiteness
    - The program end in finite step
